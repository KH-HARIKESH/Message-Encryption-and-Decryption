Developed a secure communication system with two main functionalities: encryption and decryption of messages using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). The project includes the following key features:

 Encryption: Encrypts a given message and generates a downloadable file containing both the encrypted message and the secret key.

 Decryption: Decrypts the message using the provided file, ensuring secure access to the original content.

 File Sharing: Enables secure transmission of the encrypted file via email, allowing the receiver to decrypt the message using the shared file.

 Cryptographic Algorithm: Utilized ECC for its efficiency and strong security, enhancing the protection of sensitive information.
